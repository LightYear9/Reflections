When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--You'd use a remote repository when you want to collaborate with other people or to show your progress to others who are keeping track

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--Having the github hold onto the files makes it easier search through commits without typing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
---We would use forks when we want to transfer someone's repository via github to github. Clones take github repositories and put them in the local, and branches are different paths within the local we can change between or merge together.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
--the benefit is that you can work on the current version of the master on your own without a connection

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
--I would collaborate without using Git or Github by using email or a saved file document like Google has. The email is especially hard, but the google one is easier than email.
